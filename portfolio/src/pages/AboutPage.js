      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I'm a web developer who discovered his passion in school. Now I can create full stack web applications. I take a thoughtful approach to code, keeping it as simple as possible and detailed where it matters.

JavaScript is my specialty. I'm experienced with frameworks such as React and Angular, as well as server-side Javascript with Node.js. I'm also capable at Git, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Materialize, creating and requesting from APIs, MySQL, Sequelize, MongoDB, Mongoose, Firebase, and Handlebars. If you need me to, I'll be happy to learn a new technology.</p>
