      Dear Mr. Vodola,<br />
      My name is Alexander Wetzel. While looking for opportunities for application development, I came across your listing for an intern full stack developer. I became interested as I read more about your company's advanced Wi-Fi software, and I believe I would make an excellent fit for your company.<br />
      <br />
      I'm currently in my final year of the Computer Science Program at the University of Central Florida and am on track to graduate this semester. During my time in the program, I have not only studied programming and mathematical concepts, but also worked in teams to create full stack applications. I've also explored other topics for my electives, including artificial intelligence, computer vision, and digital forensics. Additionally, I have self-taught experience in web development, with an emphasis on single page applications.<br />
      <br />
      As a highlight of my degree program, I've worked in a team of five to develop an application for our senior project. For the first phase of our project, we worked with a sponsor to determine the requirements, researched possible solutions, and created an over 150-page document outlining our design. For the second phase, we are implementing our design, dividing the work, and completing it on a weekly schedule. Currently, our project is nearly complete, and will be ready to present in the coming weeks.<br />
      <br />
      Thank you for taking the time to read my resume. I am eager for the opportunity to join your team, and I look forward to hearing back from you.<br />
      <br />
      Sincerely, <br />
      <br />
      Alexander Wetzel
